# Kairos Documentation

This is a project to revise and improve the production cycle documentation for _[Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net)_. 

## Documentation Assumptions

- Production stage tasks are distinct from reference material. These types of content should be separated and linked to to increase readability and reuse.

## Glossary Terms

There are a number of terms unique to Kairos that should be defined in a glossary. This is a running list:

- [ ] webtext
- [ ] editors server
- [ ] submissions server
- [ ] queries (design queries?)
- [ ] query page
