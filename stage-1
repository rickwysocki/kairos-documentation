====== Stage 1: Pre-Production Check ======

Stage 1 is completed by the assigned section editor. 

===== Download your text. =====

Begin by downloading your assigned webtext from the Submissions Server. Leave the original folder on the Submissions Server.

===== Create a Query Page for your webtext. =====

Navigate to the Kairos Wiki and create a new Query Page for your assigned webtext. This page will be used by editors to document changes and pass along important information throughout the production cycle.

===== Read your webtext. =====

Read through your assigned webtext offline, if possible.

:!: Note: Some texts, especially those employing Javascript, may not be readable offline.

===== Check the file directory. =====

Review the file directory for the webtext using a text editor and your file manager. Keep in mind the following important concerns.

==== 1. All (non-Praxis Wiki) webtexts must have at least one HTML file. ====

All non-Praxis Wiki webtexts //must// have at least one HTML file. Even if authors are submitting a video, podcast, etc., they must design an HTML file and embed the media within it. If there is no HTML file in the directory, message the Editor on Slack and stop here.

==== 2. All (non-Praxis Wiki) webtexts must have an index.html file. ====

There must be a file called index.html in the main directory. If the landing page is named something else, or if it’s in another directory, alert the Stage 2 editor on Slack and leave a note in the Query Page you created earlier.

==== 3. All PDF files need corresponding .docx files. ====

Make sure that all PDF files have corresponding .docx files in the file structure. Editors will usually need to edit these documents, and cannot do so with only the PDF. If these files are missing, alert the Stage 2 editor on Slack and leave a note in the Query Page you created earlier.

==== 4. Check that we have the original files for any externally embedded media files. ====

Familiarize yourself with the definitions of externally embedded media files and internally embedded media files below. The Stage 1 process for each type of content differs significantly.

  * **Externally embedded media files:** Files hosted on platforms such as YouTube, Soundcloud, etc. and that are embedded in the webtext through links to those platforms. 
  * **Internally embedded media files:** Files that are contained within the webtext's file directory and that are displayed through links to their location in the file directory.

=== For externally embedded media files: ===

== 1. Locate the Following ==

  * The original, playable media file. For example, if an author has submitted a piece with an embedded SoundCloud file, check that there is also a corresponding .wav or .mp3 file in the file directory.
  * A transcript to upload with third-party streaming sites as an .rtf file.
  * Metadata that includes: A semantic title of the content (less than five words long), a 50-word description of each media file, and 5 keywords specific to that file uploaded as a text file.

:!: **Important:** If the author has embedded media elements from //other// YouTube/Vimeo/Streaming Media content producers (e.g., a YouTube video produced by an educational organization), we should not upload a duplicate file to the KairosEditors YouTube account. Instead, use savefrom.net or keepvid.com to download a copy of that media for archiving on Kairos' servers. The webtext should still link to the originally authored media content.

== 2. Move the files ==

**Externally embedded media** files need to be moved to //Kairos//'s servers and streaming accounts. Ideally, authors will have provided those files for you, but you may need to download them yourself. (See Media Download Tools.) Moving this content allows us to keep a copy of the media files on our server (unlinked, as a backup) and to embed them with captioning. To access Kairos’s dedicated accounts for externally embedded media, see the Training Wiki.

Depending on the site, the necessary metadata might be different, but here is a general example:

  * Title: “Video Title” by Author(s) (Kairos Vol.Issue Section)
  * Descriptions: Descriptions should be 50-100 words and detail the piece of media.
  * Keywords: Check the Upcoming Issue TOC for keywords provided by the author. Additionally, add "kairos", "webtext", and "scholarly multimedia", as keywords.
  * Category: Education
  * License and rights ownership: Creative Commons (unless otherwise specified).

**Media Metadata Example**

  * “Thirdspacing the University” by Londie Martin, Ashley Holmes Response (Kairos 16.3 Praxis).
  * Using audio, video, photography, and text, Londie’s project invites readers to participate in a reflective, hypertextual environment that explores spatial and visual practices in first-year composition. This text is published in the May 2012 (16.3) issue of the Praxis section of Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, and Pedagogy. Kairos is a free, online, peer-reviewed scholarly journal available at http://kairos.technorhetoric.net.
  * Keywords: [author’s keywords], kairos, webtext, scholarly multimedia
  * Category: Education
  * License and rights ownership: Creative Commons

=== For internally embedded media files: ===

Ensure that the media files work and do nothing else. If the media is internally embedded, do not upload it to third-party sites.

==== Ensure appropriate formatting for all PDF and print-styled documents. ====

Carry out the following steps for all documents included in the webtext that might be considered "print-styled" or "article-like":

  * Include the standard header, substituting the relevant volume, issue, and author name.
  * Include the author’s name, webtext title, and page numbers.
  * Format the document using single-spaced lines.
  * Export the as a PDF and re-link it within the webtext as necessary.

**Standard Header Example:** This is [a pre-print version of / supplementary material for] the [Author’s name, if not listed in the body] webtext [title name, if not listed in the body] published in Kairos: Rhetoric, Technology, Pedagogy, Vol(Issue), available at [[http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/xx.x/section/foldername.”|http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/xx.x/section/foldername.”]]

===== Document required revisions. =====

If revisions or extra documents are needed from the author:

  * List them in the Query Page created above.
  * Copy/Paste them in a Slack message alerting the editor and all AEs that this piece needs immediate attention.

The editor will advise you on how to proceed, and the timeline on this webtext will be suspended until further notice.

===== Upload the webtext to the editors server. =====

When you are finished with Stage 1, you will upload your assigned webtext to the editors server so that it can move through the remaining stages of the production cycle. Rename the folder /authorslastname-2/ and upload it using an SFTP application to the /copy-editing/XX.X folder on the editors server. The XX.X represents the current volume and issue you’re working on.

:!: **Important:** Note that while you downloaded the assigned webtext from the **submissions server** at the beginning of this stage, you upload it to the **editors server** at the end of the stage.
